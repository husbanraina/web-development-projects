              <h3>MORAL EDUCATION</h3>
              <p>Moral values particularly refer to the conduct of man towards man in different situations wherein, the human beings face each other at home and in social, professional and economic world. In order to inculcate moral and spiritual
                values in its students, the University has introduced Moral & Spiritual Studies as a subject in its curriculum. The aim of the initiative is to help the students in character building and to cultivate special traits like patience,

              <h3>COMMUNITY INITIATIVES</h3>
              <p>Besides, imparting formal education to the younger generation, the University realizes its role for community development especially given its rural setting. We take every opportunity possible to reach out to the local community and
                seek means and mechanisms to connect to it. In this direction, IUST with the help of many expert individuals / organizations has made various efforts to reach out to the local community and raise awareness, make their grievances reach
                the authorities, apprise them of the latest technologies and trends to make their work easy and more attractive. So far the University has organised camps for seed distribution, health camps, workshop on new techniques in pottery etc.
                While identifying the need of modern education to underprivileged children, the university makes efforts at its own level to reach to them in the immediate vicinity of the campus. This is being done under Reach Out And Mentor (ROAM)
                tutoring program started by the Mantaqi Center for Science and Society. The center has drawn volunteers from students and faculty who teach students of a nearby seminary basic computer courses and other subjects that are part of
                formal system of education.
                The University has also started ‘Pesh Kadam’ a joint initiative of the Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) and PANOS India in December 2009 which is successfully going on. The capacity of IUST with its department of
                Journalism and PANOS’ experience in working on radio were brought together in this endeavor for a community based initiative using radio as a tool. The program is aimed to create a space for development of youth in the area, use radio
                as a tool or communication in voicing issues relevant to the community and to provide a technical training for the journalism students of IUST and youth of Awantipora area. With a full-fledged studio and equipment, the program also
                acts as a part of a complete and rigorous technical training regime of the University as far as broadcast journalism is concerned. With the support from Ministry of Food Processing, Government of India, University has established Food
                Processing and Training Centre (FPTC) for training of educated unemployed youth of the state to facilitate them to start their own processing units in rural areas. This will also help entrepreneurs to improve their technological
                skills. Special training programmes are identified for rural women folk</p>
